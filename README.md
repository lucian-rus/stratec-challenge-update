# stratec-challenge-update

## <u>About</u>
This project represents an updated version of my take on the Stratec 2019 Internship Challenge. While the old implementation used a hand-written algorithm to found and store the entities, this particular one uses computer vision to do the exact same things but better, faster and in much fewer lines of code. 

## <u>Dependencies</u>
* OpenCV 4.3.0
* C++11

## <u>Notes</u>
This project is ongoing. All 4 levels have been solved with the output being displayed in the debug console, but future implementations will contain a better GUI (the current one only displays the image that is being processed and the steps that the implementation takes towards solving the given challenge).
