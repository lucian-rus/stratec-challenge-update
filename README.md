# stratec-challenge-update

## <u>About</u>
This project represents an updated version of my take on the Stratec 2019 Internship Challenge using computer vision.

## <u>Dependencies</u>
* OpenCV 4.3.0
* C++11

## <u>Notes</u>
This project is ongoing, currently having solved just the first 2 levels out of the 4 existing ones. The requirements also mention a GUI, so future implementations might contain one using OpenGL.
